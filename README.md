# Minecuna Overviewer Map Server Config

A collection of config files and scripts for the running of Minecuna's Overviewer server.

This server has lived in a few places (including the cupboard where it all started!).
Unfortunately it has now been archived since we no longer play and continued upkeep cost.

The files contained here represent the latest version of the configuration.
We'd like to say a big thank you to Hynek Schlawack for his [wonderful article](https://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/) on hardening your SSL Ciphers.

You can find our overviewer configuration [here](https://github.com/minecuna/overviewer).
